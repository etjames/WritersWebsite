    <h1>Studies such as “Withholding Negative Feedback: Is It about Protecting the Self or Protecting Others?” by Jeffries and Hornsey and “Direct vs. Anonymous Feedback: Teacher Behavior in Higher Education, with
	Focus on Technology Advances” by Corelli have shown that anonymous feedback helps those involved in a variety of ways. The two most important being:<br>
	<br>
	1. People are more likely to give critical feedback when giving it anonymously, and much more reluctant to give any negative feedback when in a direct situation. While it may feel nice to only get positive reviews, constructive
	criticism is a necessary part of growth.<br>
	<br>
	2. People who recieve anonymous feedback are found to follow through and make the suggested changes.<br> 
	<br>
	Both those giving and recieving feedback need to be a part of the growth.
